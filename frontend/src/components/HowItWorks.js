          </p>

          <h2 className="howitworks-heading">ðŸ”¶ For Campaign Creators</h2>
          <ol className="howitworks-list">
            <li><strong> Register:</strong> Sign up on the platform and verify your wallet.</li>
            <li><strong> Create Campaign:</strong> Define your campaign goals, timeline, funding target, and add media like videos, descriptions, etc.</li>
            <li><strong> Smart Contract Deployment:</strong> Our platform auto-generates a smart contract for your campaign â€” ensuring funds can only be accessed if goals are met.</li>
            <li><strong> Promote:</strong> Share your campaign via social media, newsletters, and crypto communities.</li>
            <li><strong> Receive Funds:</strong> If the campaign succeeds, funds are automatically transferred to your wallet.</li>
          </ol>

            <li><strong> Contribute via Crypto:</strong> Select the project and send crypto (ETH, MATIC, or USDT) using your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask).</li>
            <li><strong> Track Impact:</strong> All transactions and milestones are recorded on the blockchain. Get notified when goals are reached.</li>
            <li><strong> Refundable Contributions:</strong> If a project fails to meet its goal, your funds are automatically refunded via smart contract.</li>
          </ol>
